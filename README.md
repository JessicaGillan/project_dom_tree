Like leaves on the wind

[A data structures, algorithms, file I/O, ruby and regular expression (regex) project from the Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

By: Jessica Gillan
(with help from Jon Popenuck & Luke Schleicher)

To run:

ruby 'exec/run.rb'

This will read in test.html, parse it, and rebuild it.
The results are output to 'rebuilt.html'

Update the filepath in run.rb to change the input html file.
You can also change the output file by specifying a new one in
run.rb
